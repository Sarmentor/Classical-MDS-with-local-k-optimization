# Classical-MDS-with-local-k-optimization
Classical MDS with k parameter optimization (local minimum)

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) with k parameter (number of clusters) optimization:

1 - Objective Function to optimize k parameter (required):

- Better Internal measures for obtained Clusters:

1.1 - In case of draw for k - 1 and/or k + 1:

- Better stability measures for one of both obtained cluster division
