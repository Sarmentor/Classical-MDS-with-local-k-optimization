# Classical-MDS-with-local-k-optimization
Classical MDS with k parameter optimization (local minimum)

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) with k parameter (number of clusters) optimization:

Objective Function to optimize k parameter (required)

- Better Internal measures for obtained Clusters
    In case of draw for k - 1 and/or k + 1:
    - Better stability measures for one of both obtained cluster division
